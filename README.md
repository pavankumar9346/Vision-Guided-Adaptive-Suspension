# Vision-Guided-Adaptive-Suspension
An intelligent suspension that adjusts damping in real time using computer vision and AI to detect road roughness, enhancing comfort and stability.

Key Features:
1. Real-Time Road Detection:
    The system analyzes the road ahead using camera input or simulated images.
    Road roughness is quantified based on visual cues such as edges, textures, and anomalies.

2. Adaptive Damping Control:
    Suspension stiffness is dynamically adjusted in response to detected roughness.
    Smooth roads result in softer damping for comfort, while rough or bumpy roads trigger stiffer suspension for stability.

3. AI-Based Decision Making:
    Uses algorithms (e.g., edge detection, neural networks, or AI models) to estimate road roughness.
    Converts roughness measurements into control signals for the suspension system.

4. Simulation and Visualization:
    The system can be tested in a virtual environment using synthetic road profiles.
    Outputs include damping values and a visual map of road roughness, allowing users to understand the system’s response.

5. Potential for Real-World Integration:
    Can be integrated with active suspension components in vehicles using embedded controllers.
    Enhances ride comfort, vehicle safety, and handling performance.
   
Applications:
1. Luxury cars for improved passenger comfort.
2. Off-road and all-terrain vehicles for adaptive handling.
3. Autonomous vehicles for predictive suspension adjustments based on upcoming road conditions.

Advantages:
1. Increases passenger comfort without compromising safety.
2. Reduces wear on suspension components by adapting to road conditions.
3. Provides a foundation for advanced AI-based automotive systems integrating vision and control.
